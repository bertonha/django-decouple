Django Decouple is now Python Decouple
======================================

**THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER ACTIVE**

*Decouple* was originally designed for Django, but became
an independent generic tool for separating settings from code.

**For that reason, django-decouple is now called python-decouple.**
